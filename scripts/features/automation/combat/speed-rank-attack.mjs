 * Register Speed Rank attack as a roll-time-only PF1e change target.
 *
 * The KOUSOKU buff stores @item.speedRank.attack on this custom deferred target so
 * PF1e does not write it to `system.attributes.attack.general` during data prep —
 * which would otherwise inflate the static CMB (cmb.total includes the general
 * attack bonus) and force a negative `cmb` compensation change. At roll time we
 * inject the bonus into every attack roll EXCEPT combat maneuvers, so it reaches
 * weapon/natural/spell attacks but never CMB. The Dodge → AC change keeps feeding
 * CMD as before.
